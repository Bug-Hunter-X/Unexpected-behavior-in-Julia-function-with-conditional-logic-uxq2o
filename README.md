# Julia Function with Conditional Logic

This repository contains a simple Julia function demonstrating the use of conditional logic (if-elseif-else) and return statements.  The function calculates the square of a number, with the result negated if the input is negative. The example includes test cases for positive, zero, and negative inputs.

## Potential Issues

While the provided code functions as intended, there might be subtle errors possible in the logic, such as missing edge cases or unexpected behaviors with certain inputs. This example illustrates the potential of having edge case scenarios that might not always be considered.
